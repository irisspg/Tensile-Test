# Tensile Test Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the results of a **tensile test**, a mechanical test used to determine the properties of a material under tension. The objective is to evaluate parameters such as **ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength, and elongation**.

## Project Details
- **Methodology:** Tensile test conducted on a sample material.
- **Calculations:** Performed in Microsoft Excel.
- **Results:** Stress-strain curves, rupture points, and deformation analysis.

## Key Parameters Calculated
- **Stress (σ):** Force per unit area.
- **Strain (ε):** Deformation relative to original length.
- **Elastic modulus (E):** Material stiffness.
- **Yield strength:** Stress at which permanent deformation begins.
- **Ultimate tensile strength (UTS):** Maximum stress before rupture.
- **Fracture point:** Final breaking point of the material.

## Results and Graphs
The following graphs were obtained from Excel:
1. **Stress-Strain Curve** – Visual representation of material response.
2. **Deformation Analysis** – Comparison of elongation before and after failure.

## How to Use
1. Open `Tensile_Test_Data.xlsx` in Excel.
2. Review the raw data and computed values.
3. Check the graphs for insights on material behavior.
4. Refer to `Report.pdf` for a detailed analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Automate calculations using Python.
- Expand the dataset for different materials.
- Compare results with simulation models.
